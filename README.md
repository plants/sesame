# Sesame

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BrianHicks/sesame.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/BrianHicks/sesame)

A Go library for implementing user storage over the network.

Left to do:

 - storage backends
 - a server/client (probably using [go-discover][go-discover] and some sort of JSON RPC)

And if you know anything about cryptography, please do have a look. I would
really appreciate more eyes on this code.
