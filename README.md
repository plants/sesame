# Sesame

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/plants/sesame.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/plants/sesame)

A Go library for implementing user storage over the network.

Left to do:

 - storage backends
 - a server/client (probably using [go-discover][go-discover] and some sort of JSON RPC)

And if you know anything about cryptography, please do have a look. I would
really appreciate more eyes on this code.

## Releases

There aren't any releases yet. When there are, they'll be tagged in the
"master" branch. But the master branch will always have the stable version of
the code, and the develop branch will always have the bleeding edge.
